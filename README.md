## Source code for my tutorial on Developing a Decentralized Identity Solution on Celo

This repository contains the source code for a tutorial on developing a decentralized identity solution on the Celo blockchain. The tutorial covers setting up a development environment, creating smart contracts, and building a simple user interface for interacting with the decentralized identity system.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- Yarn (version 1.x or higher) or npm (version 6.x or higher)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository:
bash
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-identity-celo.git```
```cd decentralized-identity-celo```

- Install the dependencies using Yarn or npm:
With Yarn:
```yarn install```
With npm:
```npm install```
Start the development server:
With Yarn:
```yarn start```
With npm:
```npm start```
The development server should now be running, and you can access the user interface in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
